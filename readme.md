Emailer
====

A utility I wrote to send emails to a mailing list. It's rough around the edges 
but got the job done. Some of the code is re-usable and may be of interest to
anyone wanting to know how to send an e-mail with C#/.NET.


Usage
====

        Simply edit the config.xml file for your SMTP settings. The main input is
		a CSV file of email addresses.
